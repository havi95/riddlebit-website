          We at Riddlebit Software have a vault of concepts for games waiting for their turn to be made. The first of these games, and our focus for the foreseeable future, is Setback.
          Setback is an on-foot, science fiction, racing game where you compete in a game of speed while sabotaging your opponents through both space and time.
