                    Riddlebit Software was founded in late 2017 in Trondheim, Norway.
                    We are located at <a href="https://work-work.no/">Work-Work</a>.
                    Currently we are working on the game "Setback", a fast-paced online shooter.
                    Setback won us two awards at the <a href="https://gameawards.no/">Norwegian Game Awards</a> in 2018.
                    Since then, we have attended events such as <a href="https://torucon.no/en/home/">Torucon</a> and <a href="https://www.spillexpo.no/">SpillExpo</a> with
                    a multiplayer demo of Setback. Both of which were a really good experience for us.
