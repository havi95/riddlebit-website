                    Riddlebit Software was founded in late 2017.
                    However, it all really started in February 2018
                    when we won two awards at <a href="https://gameawards.no/">Norwegian Game Awards</a>.
                    Both awards were for our current project "Setback",
                    which had only been in development for a month.
                    That was a big deal for us as a company because it showed we had a
                    solid proof of concept that we could continue to work on.
                    Since then, we have attended events such as <a href="https://torucon.no/en/home/">Torucon</a> and <a href="https://www.spillexpo.no/">SpillExpo</a> with
                    a multiplayer demo of Setback. Both of which were a really good experience for us.
