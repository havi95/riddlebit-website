                    Riddlebit Software was founded late in 2017.
                    But it all really started in February 2018,
                    when we won two awards at Norwegian Game Awards.
                    Both awards were for our current project "Setback",
                    which had only been in development for a month.
                    That was a big deal for us as a company because it showed we had a
                    solid proof of concept that we could continue to work on.
                    Since then, we have attended events such as Torucon and SpillExpo with a multiplayer demo of Setback.
                    Both of which was a really good experience for us.
